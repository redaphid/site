*Or how engineers tend to transform creative projects into engineering ones over time.*

I love music. As a technical person who considers creating things to be incredibly important, I wanted to learn how to compose my own tracks using Ableton. I set about learning how to do this with a friend 2 years ago, who was also just beginning to learn the process.

Of course, I was totally illiterate when it came to anything music-related. I never learned how to read sheet music, and my experience with playing an instrument was limited to "learning" the recorder in 4th grade after joining the class halfway through the year. (Whether skills beyond "the basics" exist for playing recorders is a question for future generations).

Though I spent a lot of time learning Ableton, I often found myself switching tasks from my stated goal to experimenting with a different feature Ableton offers: creating entirely new instruments to play. The transition was a slow, inevitable, and nearly unnoticeable one. I justified little steps along the way as helping my actual goal of music creation. After all, I was spending so much time Ableton How could I *not* be learning how to make music?

I spent progressively longer periods of time on these technical distractions, and would often end my Ableton activities proud of how much time I spent learning the software, despite having accomplished something only tangentally related to my stated goal.

 Eventually I spent too many sleepless nights accomplishing this new engineering goal *related* to the original and burned out, having learned almost nothing about actual music composition.

 I gradually became aware that many of my personal projects followed a similar trajectory. I made fun of myself to friends and coworkers in order to vent frustration about this harmful mental process I didn't understand. I started to notice the same pattern in some projects undertaken by otherwise-disciplined developer friends. I noticed it at work, where it was more easily hidden as most tasks were largely comprised of an engineering efforts.
 
 I started talking to people about the problem over and over, which is my usual way of thinking through a things. This resulted in a pretty well-honed rant and a common part of Aaron's Oral Tradition (tm).
