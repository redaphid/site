*Or how engineers tend to transform creative projects into engineering ones over time.*

I love music. As a technical person who considers creating things to be one his important values, I wanted to learn how to compose my own tracks using Ableton, and sometime last year I set about learning how to do this with a friend of mine, who was just beginning to learn himself.

I was, of course, totally illiterate when it came to anything music-related. I never learned how to read sheet music, and my experience with playing an instrument was limited to barely learning how to play the recorder in 4th grade, having missed the basics because I started the class halfway through the semester. (Assuming there is more to learn about a recorder than "the basics", but you get my point).

Though I spent a lot of time learning Ableton, I often found myself switching tasks between what I wanted to do (compose a new song) to another feature Ableton offers: creating new, virtual instruments to use in said compositions. I found myself feeling much more motivation to play with this aspect of Ableton, even though I was equally inexperienced in doing so. In fact, most of the time in which I started with the explicit goal of learning composition, only to have that activity slowly devolve into yet another intensely focused instrument-creation session. Each time, I was able to justify this because I was still learning Ableton, and "music creation" in a broad sense, yet I had clearly undermined my own goal. Eventually I burned out after too many nights ignoring sleep to accomplish this new goal *adjacent* to the one I had been meaning to accomplish, and have not attempted to learn music composition since.
