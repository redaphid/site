*Or how engineers tend to transform creative projects into engineering ones over time.*

I love music. As a technical person who considers creating things to be incredibly important, I wanted to learn how to compose my own tracks using Ableton. I set about learning how to do this with a friend 2 years ago, who was also just beginning to learn the process.

Of course, I was totally illiterate when it came to anything music-related. I never learned how to read sheet music, and my experience with playing an instrument was limited to "learning" the recorder in 4th grade after joining the class halfway through the year. (Whether skills beyond "the basics" exist for playing recorders is a question for future generations).

Though I spent a lot of time learning Ableton, I often found myself switching tasks from my stated goal to experimenting with a different feature Ableton offered: creating entirely new instruments to play. The transition was a slow, inevitable, and nearly unnoticeable one. I justified little steps along the way as helping my actual goal of music creation. After all, I was spending so much time Ableton! How could I *not* be learning how to make music?

I spent progressively longer periods of time on these technical distractions, and would often end my Ableton activities proud of how much time I spent learning the software, despite having accomplished something only tangentally related to my stated goal.

 Eventually I spent too many sleepless nights accomplishing this new engineering goal *related* to the original and burned out, having learned almost nothing about actual music composition.

 I gradually became aware that many of my personal projects followed a similar trajectory. I made fun of myself to friends and coworkers in order to vent frustration about this harmful mental process that I didn't understand. I started to notice the same pattern in some projects undertaken by otherwise-disciplined developer friends. I noticed it at work, where it was easily hidden as most tasks were largely comprised of engineering efforts.

 I love to talk about pretty much anything, and inevitably started talking to people about this over and over, gaining more insight into the problem each time. It became a mainstay of Aaron's Oral Tradition (tm): a series of stories and rants I repeat often enough to annoy anyone with regular exposure to me. I'd often thought about making a blog to store this "knowledge" to give everyone around me a break from my constant repetitive monologues. With some free time on my hands a few months ago, I embarked on a personal project to start a blog.

Then The Problem struck. I somehow sidelined a simple blog project into a pure engineering one, following the familiar pattern of burning out and abandoning it after working on the interesting engineering aspects. Turning a blog project into an engineering one is a particularly ridiculous example of The Problem, so I started using it as an extreme example of this pattern during my irregularly-scheduled rants. 

Months later, I restarted the blog project from scratch, this time very mindful that it was susceptible to The Problem. As a result, I was able to avoid it and create this incredibly stylish blog.

When it came time to write my first post, I knew what I had to do.

## The Problem
