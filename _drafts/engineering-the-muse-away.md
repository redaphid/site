*Or how engineers tend to transform creative projects into engineering ones over time.*

I love music. As a technical person who considers creating things to be incredibly important, I wanted to learn how to compose my own tracks using Ableton. I set about learning how to do this with a friend sometime last year, who also just beginning to learn the process.

Of course I was totally illiterate when it came to anything music-related. I never learned how to read sheet music, and my experience with playing an instrument was limited to barely learning the recorder in 4th grade, after starting the class halfway through the year. (Whether there exists a skill beyond "the basics" for a recorder is a question philosophers ponder to this day).

Though I spent a lot of time learning Ableton, I often found myself switching tasks from what I wanted to do (compose a new song) to another feature Ableton offers: creating new, virtual instruments to play in these compositions. The transition was slow, inevitable, nearly unnoticeable one: I would justify little steps along the way as helping my actual goal of music creation with these increasingly time-intensive technical tasks. I spent a lot of time on these technical distractions, and would often end my Ableton activities proud of how much time I spent learning the software, despite having accomplished almost none of the original goal.

 I found myself feeling much more motivation to play with this aspect of Ableton, even though I was equally inexperienced in doing so. In fact, most of the time in which I started with the explicit goal of learning composition, only to have that activity slowly devolve into yet another intensely focused instrument-creation session. Each time, I was able to justify this because I was still learning Ableton, and "music creation" in a broad sense, yet I had clearly undermined my own goal. Eventually I burned out after too many nights ignoring sleep to accomplish this new goal *adjacent* to the one I had been meaning to accomplish, and have not attempted to learn music composition since.
