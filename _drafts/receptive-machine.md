# The Receptive Machine
###### *Or, how to get your ideas out of your head so you can finally go to sleep.*

This post may be pretty obvious advice, and may have been written by someone more authoritative already. But I wanted to explain a simple system I started practicing that helped me record my ideas and feelings, and thus helped reduce a mental habit I didn't know existed that was occupying a lot of my mental capacity and causing anxiety as a result.

I've since continued to develop this "system", with a focus on low-commitment self-analysis that I think would be helpful for a lot of people. This is the lowest-commitment approach - the first rung on the ladder. While it's useful by itself, I will continue this series with progressively more unique ways I was finally able understand myself better and organize my life.

# The problem

### **I'm an *ideas* guy, maaaan. I think big picture. I just need you to turn my ideas into an app.**
###### *- some sales douche, probably.*

I love ideas, but they're often given a bad rap. Ideas are exciting, but implemention is *work*. And it's work that turns those ideas into reality. Most ideas don't make it through the birthing process, and end up spending their existences incorporeal, haunting their creators with dim memories of once-cherished dreams.

But ideas are fun. Fun to think about, fun to dream about when you don't quite have the brainpower to think about more important things or get things done. Fun to turn over in your mind when you aren't doing anything else. Like, say, trying to sleep.

Ideas are so much fun that they contribute to my insomnia. I spend a lot of time sort of "whittling" an idea down in my head, resolving it, imagining what it would be like.
All day, but particularly when it gets later at night, I start to worry that I'll forget some aspect or philosophy of an idea if I fall asleep, and that's enough to keep me running it over and over in my head, keeping me awake.

And I love sleep.

Most of my ideas are nonesense. Even still, the rare times I would write them down, I'd get bogged down trying to organize fractions of half-finished thoughts into a narrative that stood a chance of ever making sense to anybody. Rearranging the structure and wording of sentences only I would see.

Even worse, almost every time the muse strikes, it does so while you're doing something else. Opening up a notebook or input-heavy app to write coherent sentences is usually *far* too distracting or time-consuming to justify interrupting whatever you're doing. This would cause me to obsessively think about this new idea, or something I needed to do in the near future. Or even just something interesting that happened that day, and would make a good story later.

I thought about these things over and over, both to perfect them in my mind and memorize them in hopes that I wouldn't lose them.

Eventually one of these ideas was about, ironically, how to stop worrying about losing stories or ideas without much overhead. What follows is that simple meta-idea that has begun to lessen the cognitive load of this problem.

# The (partial) solution

### Think of your stream of consciousness as your "native language".

Our minds don't think in paragraphs, or sometimes even sentences. Brains are massively parallel, and at any time can be thinking about multiple ideas, plans, and emotions at the same time. One of the difficulties of writing down an idea/story/etc is that it requires us to "translate" between this disorganized, concurrent mess into something that makes sense organizationally in our language of choice.

### Translation from your native language takes time

Often too much time, given that we're usually doing something else when ideas pop into our heads. However, if we were to write things down in our "native language" - full of sentence fragments, out-of-order descriptions of the ideas mixed with emotions, stories, and anything else we wanted to remember, it would take us much less time to register the thought, while mitigating the fear of losing it. This frees up our mind to focus on other things besides the idea throughout the day, and significantly reduces our cognitive load.


### Translation from your native language can be fun

...when you have actually dedicated time to do it.

Unlike 

The same pattern occured when thinking about something interesting that happened today, and how it could make a good story. Or when I thought of long-term, repeatable goals (like stop looking like a hobo and shave every 3 days).

Even simple things, like *Why do I feel so bad right now? Am I having a caffeine crash? How long ago did I drink my last cup of coffee?* were questions that would occupy my thoughts and interrupt me from whatever (obviously very important) thing I was doing before.
