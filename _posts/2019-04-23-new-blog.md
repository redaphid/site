Look at how amazing my blog is. 

I was planning to make my own blogging software, using nearly the ***exact*** same system that Jekyll uses. Including the Front Matter metadata. I mean, why use an existing, hugely commercially-supported blogging system that does exactly what you want, when I can make a buggy and unstable one all by myself?

In the end, I decided not to have fun coding, and do the real work of actually organizing my thoughts enough to post something. I've noticed a tendency for developers to do what I call "reduce a creative problem to an engineering problem", which is something I hope to write about soon.
