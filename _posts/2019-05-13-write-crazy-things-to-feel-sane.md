##### *Or, how to get your ideas out of your head so you can finally go to sleep.*

Disclaimer: This post may be obvious advice, or may have been written by someone more authoritative already. But I wanted to explain a simple system I started practicing that helped me record my ideas and feelings, and thus helped reduce a mental habit I didn't know existed that was occupying a lot of my mental capacity and causing anxiety as a result.

I've since continued to develop this system, with a focus on low-commitment self-analysis I think would be helpful for a lot of people. This is the lowest-tech approach - the first rung on the ladder. It requires the longest "organizational step" While it's useful by itself, I will continue this series with progressively more helpful and lower-effort ways I found to better understand myself and organize my life.

I've been talking constantly to friends and family members about these methods, and figured it was time to put it one place in hopes it helps others as well!

## The problem

### I'm an *ideas* guy, maaaan. I think big picture. I just need you to turn my ideas into an app.
###### *- some sales douche, probably.*

*To keep things simple, you can substitute "how I'm feeling now/things I have to do/funny story about what happened today" for "idea" when reading this. The same problem exists for these things.*

I love ideas, but they're often given a bad rap. Ideas are exciting, but implemention is *work*. And it's work that turns those ideas into reality. Most ideas don't make it through the birthing process, and end up spending their existences incorporeal, haunting their creators with dim memories of once-cherished dreams.

But ideas are fun. Fun to think about, fun to dream about when you don't have the brainpower for more important things. Fun to turn over in your mind when you aren't doing anything else. Like, say, trying to sleep.

Ideas are so much fun that they contribute to my insomnia. I spend a lot of time sort of "whittling" an idea down in my head, imagining what it would be like.
I often start to worry that I'll forget some aspect or philosophy of an idea. And if I'm trying to sleep, it's enough to keep me examining the idea over and over in my head, keeping me awake.

And I love sleep.

Most of my ideas are nonesense. Still, the rare times I would write them down, I'd get bogged down trying to organize fractions of half-finished thoughts into a narrative could stand a chance of ever making sense to anybody. Rearranging the structure and wording of sentences only I would see.

Even worse, almost every time the muse would strike, it did so while I was doing something else. Opening up a notebook or input-heavy app to write coherent sentences was usually *far* too distracting or time-consuming to justify interrupting whatever I was doing. This would cause me to either quickly forget the idea or obsessively think about it.

I thought about these things over and over, both to perfect them in my mind and memorize them in hopes that I wouldn't lose them.

Eventually one of these ideas was, coincidentally, about how to stop worrying about these ideas without too much overhead. What follows is that simple meta-idea that has begun to lessen the cognitive load of this problem.

## The (partial) solution

### Think of your stream of consciousness as your native language.

Our minds don't think in paragraphs, or sometimes even sentences. Brains are massively parallel, and at any time can be thinking about multiple ideas, plans, and emotions at the same time. One of the difficulties of writing down an idea/story/etc is that it requires us to "translate" between this disorganized, concurrent mess into something that makes sense organizationally in our language of choice.

### Translation from your native language takes time

Often too much time, given that we're usually doing something else when ideas pop into our heads. However, if we were to write things down in our "native language" - full of sentence fragments, out-of-order descriptions of the ideas mixed with emotions, stories, and anything else we wanted to remember, it would take us much less time to register the thought, while mitigating the fear of losing it. This frees up our mind to focus on other things besides the idea throughout the day, and significantly reduces our cognitive load.


### Translation can be fun when separated from recording

...when you actually dedicate time for it, specifically.

It lets you think about the idea again and really enjoy it, because it's not interrupting other tasks. It lets you throw away the ridiculous ones, and organize the good ones into a cohesive unit. This unit may not be a complete description yet, but at least an organized one.

This blog post is an example of this process in action. I first wrote about it (and a million other things) in a fast "stream of consciousness" form that made me sound like the [time cube guy](http://timecube.2enp.com) (although with no formatting, which is important). Later I dedicated some time to translating and organizing this idea, which even later finally became reality.

Pictured below is an example of my early Stream Of Consciousness document, which recorded some fragments of ideas related to the blog post:

As you can see, lots of crazy ideas here. But some of them ended up being this process I just described!

### Simple, practical steps

Since by now I'm sure I've convinced you to write like a maniac on a regular basis, here's some quick tips on how to make it less intrusive in your life.

#### Make sure you're using a writing program that is easily accessible to you at all times

I've been using Google Docs, and just keeping it open in a tab all the time. Docs also has an *okay* app for your phone, so you can scratch out quick ideas on the go, which is critical.

Though it's important to write quickly, try to include the date (or at least the time) that you're recording your thought. It might help you remember what you were thinking about, and I like the idea of this timeline of thought that continues throughout your life. This will also be important as we evolve this idea in the future.

#### Do some basic quantitative ranking of yourself
Try to do things like rank your mood, how tired you are, or whatever pops into your head on a scale from 1-10 preceded by a colon (:). I do things like **Mood:6** in the middle of writing to record my emotional state at the time.
These can found quickly and copied into an excel or google sheets to do some long-term analysis on yourself, like if exercising helps you sleep better, or less obvious correlations I'll dive into in a future post.

The Excel/Sheets step, admittedly, is kind of a pain in the ass. So if you're not interested in it, don't do it! But it can be quite helpful.


#### For the insomniacs: pick a "shutoff time" where you stop recording thoughts
I mentioned earlier that these racing thoughts were contributing to my ongoing insomnia. This process has helped, but only while also agreeing to stop writing an hour or so before bed. Anything important I came up with during the day has been written down already. Chill out. I have found that very slowly and mindfully reading a book with a lot of imagery can help push intrusive thoughts out of my head, much like meditation. Make sure you're using your mind to visualize the scene described in the book as fully as possible. If you notice you're getting distracted with some other thought, re-read the last paragraph until you have a clear mental picture of what's going on. 

## The future

We can improve upon this process in a few ways:

- Make the "record" step faster.
- Make the "organization" step more automatic.
- End up with a cool, continuous timeline of our life, thoughts and feelings.

If we lower the barrier to entry of recording our thoughts, we can record more without interrupting our lives.

If we make the organization step more automatic, it makes it less work, and more fun.

I'd like to get off of google docs & sheets eventually and get to something prettier, but it's doing a good enough job for now!

If anyone likes this idea and wants to read more, send a tweet to @redaphid about it, or talk about it in the Reddit comments. I made this site as basic as possible just to get something out, but I have a lot of tips and templates to speed up the process if you buy into the basic premise.

Here are a couple of screenshots to pique your interest. They can all be done yourself, for free:
